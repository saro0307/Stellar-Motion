# Stellar Motion Project using MATLAB

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains MATLAB code for the Stellar Motion project. The project involves analyzing stellar data, calculating stellar motion, and comparing stellar spectra. The main components of the project are organized into three MATLAB MAT files: `starData.mat`, `StellarMotion.mat`, and `Comparing_Stellar_Spectra.mat`.

## Contents

### 1. starData.mat

This MAT file contains essential data related to stars. The data includes information such as star positions, brightness, and spectral characteristics. This file serves as the foundational dataset for the Stellar Motion project.

### 2. StellarMotion.mat

The `StellarMotion.mat` file is the second part of the project. It includes MATLAB code that calculates the motion of stars based on the data provided in `starData.mat`. This part of the project aims to analyze the dynamics of stellar objects and visualize their motion over time.

### 3. Comparing_Stellar_Spectra.mat

The `Comparing_Stellar_Spectra.mat` file contains MATLAB code for comparing stellar spectra. It involves analyzing the spectral characteristics of different stars and identifying patterns or variations. This part of the project contributes to a deeper understanding of the diversity of stellar objects.
